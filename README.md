## What Does *Teleporting* add?

A lot of the details are customizable!

Check the mod settings!

**Four (4) tiers of research**

### **Static Spatial Conduits**
This research allows for teleports to and from fixed locations.

It unlocks the following:
 - **Teleport Console** work-bench (misc. tab)
 
 - **Teleport Cartridge** recipe
 
  *A base resource required for teleportation.*
 
 - **Teleport Receiver**
 
   *A relatively cheap receive-only teleporter. Can be named. Serves as a targetable destination for static spatial conduits.*
   
 - **Teleport Platform**
 
   *Can be named as well as linked to another named platform or receiver. Use it by selecting a colonist and right-clicking the teleport platform. Once it\'s linked, right-click to use the teleporter. Teleporting costs nothing but does have a cooldown, and the platform is bound to whatever it was linked with. You can unlink and retarget to a different destination, but doing so consumes teleport cartridges.*
   
 - **Linkable Teleport Belt** recipe
 
   *Can be linked to a named platform or receiver and teleport the wearer to it. Similar to the teleport platform, teleporting has a cooldown and doesn't consume cartridges, but unlinking does.*

### **Dynamic Spatial Conduits**
This research allows for teleports to and from almost any location.

It unlocks the following:

  - **Portable Teleport Unit (SR)** recipe
  
    *A one-time-use teleport device. The short-range PTU can be used by a pawn to teleport anywhere on the same map.*
	
  - **Portable Teleport Unit (LR)** recipe
  
    *A one-time-use teleport device. The long-range PTU can be used by a pawn to teleport between loaded maps on the same planet, within fuel and range limits.*

### **Spatial Folding**
This research allows for more efficient use of PTU\'s by turning them into teleport apparel, which have multiple uses before they\'re consumed.

It unlocks the following:

 - **Teleport Belt (SR)** recipe
 
   *Short-range teleporting within the same map. Consumable.*
   
 - **Teleport Belt (LR)** recipe
 
   *Long-range teleporting between loaded maps, within fuel and range limits. Consumable.*

### **Mastery of Teleportation**

This research gives the most advanced teleportation technology.

It unlocks the following:

 - **Teleport Belt (Adv.)** recipe
 
   *Capable of both Short and Long range teleportation, as well as teleporting other pawns besides the wearer; and with more fuel. Consumable.*
   
 - **Teleport Console** advanced functionality
 
   *The Console can right-click operated by a pawn to perform short and long range teleports. The cooldown is greatly affected by the operator\'s intelect skill. Consuming many Teleport Cartridges, it\'s expensive compared to belts but very powerful.*
